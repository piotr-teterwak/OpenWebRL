# ARM inference scaling

- **SFT actor + Piotr SelectionARM:** **+5.67 ± 1.15 percentage points** (mean ± sample SD) across three complete runs.
- **RL actor + Piotr:** **42.67% → 54.00%**, a **+11.33-point gain [+5.33, +17.33]** in one complete paired run.
- **Selection rule:** random-of-five reaches **33.33%** and highest-likelihood-of-five **26.67%**, versus **33.00%** for SFT and **40.00%** for Piotr. Controls were collected separately.
- **Other selectors:** Sol/GPT-5.5 add **10–12 points**; Luna/Kev add about **9 points** under a different protocol. These are not controlled cross-protocol rankings.
- **Still unresolved:** whether 50 steps or an RL-trained actor increases Piotr's gain relative to the SFT 30-step comparison.

Every main result uses the same **300 Online-Mind2Web tasks**. Invalid and unjudged episodes count as zero. “Success” is the canonical o4-mini/AgentTrek verdict, which permits partial progress. **N** means candidates generated per decision; one is executed. Gains are percentage points (**pp**); intervals quantify task sampling, not judge error or website drift.

| RL-task-trained SelectionARM | 5 | 300 | 123 | 41.00% | +9.33 | [+4.00, +14.67] |

- **Random control:** pick uniformly among five candidate indices at **every step**, including duplicates and malformed candidates. It reuses the Oct 7 SFT/Piotr episodes above. Piotr beats random by **+6.67 pp [+1.00, +12.33]**; random shows no detectable gain over SFT.
- **Likelihood control:** choose the highest mean native base-policy log-probability of the full response, including reasoning. It trails random by **−6.67 pp [−12.00, −1.33]** and Piotr by **−13.33 pp [−18.67, −8.00]**. This is one run with reused controls, not a general test of confidence gating. [Action-only follow-up](ARM_INFERENCE.md#action-only-likelihood-20261008).
- **Horizon:** the 50-step pair has a fresh SFT control. Its gain exceeds the same-day 30-step gain by **+2.33 pp [−4.67, +9.33]**; no clear horizon effect.
- **Selector training:** RL-task-trained SelectionARM changes the **selector**, while the actor stays SFT. It reuses the earlier SFT control from the API-selector study below; this is not a matched ranking against Piotr.

The Oct 7 Piotr row is the third run above, not an extra repeat. Collections used separate browser episodes and times.

Sol/GPT-5.5 use medium reasoning and 2,048 selector tokens; Luna uses medium reasoning and 4,096. Jev/Kev use choice classifiers.

**Sol reproduces a similar rate to September:** 43.33% now versus 44.00% then. Sol versus GPT-5.5 is inconclusive: **+1.33 pp [−3.67, +6.33]**. Luna/Kev differ by one success; Jev's gain interval includes zero.

## Sol: does increasing the candidate count help?

**N=10 improves over N=3 by +6.67 pp [95% paired interval: +2.00, +11.67]**, at **3.28× the mean actor output tokens**. Both arms used the corrected September protocol above and were collected together on the same 300 tasks.

| Condition | N | Collection | Tasks | Successes | Success | Gain vs SFT, pp | Valid tasks | Invalid tasks | Valid-only success |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| SFT alone / no selector | 1 | Earlier control | 300 | 95 | 31.67% | — | 273 | 27 | 34.80% |
| SFT + Sol | 3 | Fresh paired study | 300 | 121 | 40.33% | +8.67 | 266 | 34 | 45.49% |
| SFT + Sol | 5 | Earlier reference | 300 | 130 | 43.33% | +11.67 | 268 | 32 | 48.51% |
| SFT + Sol | 10 | Fresh paired study | 300 | 141 | 47.00% | +15.33 | 264 | 36 | 53.41% |

N=10 wins alone on 38 tasks; N=3 wins alone on 18. Invalid episodes remain zero in the primary denominator. The SFT-alone control and N=5 reference come from the [earlier API-selector study](#api-selector-results-20261007) under the same corrected September protocol; comparisons with N=3/N=10 include collection-date differences. These are canonical o4-mini/AgentTrek scores, which permit partial progress; three targeted positive flags remain documented without relabeling.

<summary>Cost and paired sensitivity</summary>

| Candidates | Mean actor output tokens/task | Mean episode latency, s | All-attempt selector charge/reservation, USD |

| 3 | 14,342 | 219.38 | 96.18 |
| 10 | 47,051 | 249.91 | 150.51 |

On the 255 tasks valid in both arms, the gain is +7.45 pp [95% paired interval: +1.96, +12.94]. Primary intervals use 10,000 task bootstrap draws, seed 42; they do not include judge error or website drift. Latency is time to result and includes overlapping work, not GPU compute. Shared campaign usage was 5.57 H200-hours and 618 browser attempts, including interrupted attempts. API charges/reservations are conservative ledger values, not invoices.

### How much action diversity do the extra candidates add?

**At the same saved N=10 states, candidates 4–10 add 3.61 distinct parsed action specifications**, on average, beyond the first three (95% task-bootstrap interval **[3.45, 3.76]**). Sol selects a specification absent from the first three in **38.1%** of decisions, averaging within each task and then equally across tasks.

| Candidates retained from each N=10 panel | Mean distinct specifications | 95% interval |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| First 3 | 2.37 | [2.33, 2.42] |
| First 5 | 3.52 | [3.43, 3.61] |
| All 10 | 5.98 | [5.78, 6.17] |

These are **4,205 decisions from 279 tasks**; 21 episodes without candidate panels are excluded from diversity means. Specifications distinguish tool-call sequences and exact arguments, including coordinates and final-answer text. They exclude reasoning and formatting. Merging terminal wording and grouping coordinates into 50-unit bins reduces the added diversity to **1.33 classes [1.24, 1.43]**. This sensitivity check is not semantic UI-target matching; the saved evidence lacks target identities. The analysis establishes additional proposals, not their usefulness or a causal explanation of the success gain.

<details>
<summary>Actual N=3/5/10 runs, diversity plot and method</summary>

| Actual Sol run | Audited episodes | Tasks with panels | Saved decisions | Mean distinct specifications | 95% interval | Unparseable candidates | Total candidates |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| N=3 | 300 | 279 | 4,323 | 2.27 | [2.22, 2.33] | 35 | 12,969 |
| N=5, earlier collection | 300 | 279 | 4,221 | 3.44 | [3.33, 3.53] | 53 | 21,105 |
| N=10 | 300 | 279 | 4,205 | 5.98 | [5.78, 6.17] | 120 | 42,050 |

These actual runs visit different states; N=5 also has a different collection date. The main table instead holds each N=10 panel fixed. It does not rerun the selector on smaller panels or estimate their counterfactual success. Averaging every possible 3-of-10 and 5-of-10 subset gives 2.37 and 3.53 distinct specifications, consistent with the ordered-prefix comparison.

![Additional candidate diversity at the same saved states](arm_results/sol_action_diversity_20261008/action-diversity.png)

The selected specification is absent from the first three in 1,378 of 4,204 decisions with a parseable selection: pooled rate 32.78%, versus the task-weighted 38.13% [35.77, 40.54] above. Beyond the first five, the task-weighted added count is 2.46 [2.34, 2.57], and selection novelty is 24.94% [22.91, 27.11]. Later indices that duplicate an earlier specification are not novel.

The native Qwen25 parser and ordered tool-call sequences match the frozen execution path. Parsing does not establish executability: missing required arguments and generation-length stops are audited separately. Normalizing executor defaults and ignored arguments leaves 3.59 additional specifications beyond three; merging terminal wording alone leaves 2.74. Coordinate bins remain a coarse proxy, not a bound on semantic diversity.

Means first average observed decisions within task, then weight tasks equally. Intervals use 10,000 task-bootstrap samples. Input hashes, all 900 episode identities, candidate counts, selector indices and parser behavior were independently checked; ten focused tests passed. All analysis used saved evidence, with no new browser or model calls. [Aggregate metrics and definitions](arm_results/sol_action_diversity_20261008/aggregate.json).

## GPT-6.1 Sol at N=5: actor controls and reasoning effort

**WebVoyager shows a measured benefit from the Sol61 medium N=5 pipeline over its matching SFT N=1 control:** **57.98% versus 46.72%**, a **+11.26 pp** difference with a **95% paired task-bootstrap interval of [+7.39, +15.13]**. DeepShop remains inconclusive: **46.00% versus 42.67%**, or **+3.33 pp [−5.33, +11.33]**. These controls match weights, decoding, tasks, browsers and native judges, but were collected sequentially; the intervals do not cover website/judge drift or run-to-run variability.

**Higher selector effort did not establish an improvement on Online-Mind2Web:** medium scored **45.67%** and high **43.67%**, with high minus medium **−2.00 pp [−7.33, +3.33]**. Those contemporaneous runs use the same 300 tasks, five SFT action proposals per decision, and a shared 2,048-token selector output cap.

| Benchmark | Condition | N | Collection | Tasks | Successes | Valid | Invalid | Overall | Valid-only |

All displayed cohorts are verified complete. Against the closest historical SFT control, Sol61 medium and high are descriptively **+12.67 and +10.67 percentage points** overall. Against the earlier seed-42 control, the gaps are +14.00 and +12.00 points. These comparisons reuse October 7 outcomes; they do not isolate a causal selector gain from collection-date, seed or runtime differences.

Overall includes invalid records as zero; valid-only excludes each condition's invalids. On the **same 250 tasks valid in both Sol61 OM2W conditions**, medium succeeded on **134** and high on **128**: high minus medium **−2.40 pp [−8.40, +3.60]**. Neither comparison supports a reliable effort effect. This tests reasoning effort within N=5. The historical controls match the nominal SFT actor/judge protocol, but there is no contemporaneous N=1 control.

<a id="sol61-actor-controls-20261009"></a>

**Both matching SFT N=1 controls are verified.** They preserve the official-SFT weights, actor decoding, local browser and native benchmark judge used by Sol61, with zero selector calls. The positive WebVoyager result persists on the tasks valid in both conditions; DeepShop's intervals include zero in both analyses.

| Benchmark | Paired population | Tasks | N1 successes | N5 successes | N5 − N1, pp | Paired 95% interval, pp |

| DeepShop | Valid in both conditions | 143 | 63 | 69 | +4.20 | [−4.20, +12.59] |

WebVoyager has 107 N5-only successes and 40 N1-only successes; DeepShop has 23 and 18. Pairing controls task identity. Common-valid estimates exclude 48 and seven tasks respectively, conditioning on availability in both arms. Intervals use 10,000 paired task-bootstrap resamples with seed 42. The WebVoyager result supports this N=5 selection pipeline under the saved native labels; it does not isolate selection from the additional proposal generation or establish a general gain across benchmarks. DeepShop's result establishes neither a reliable benefit nor equivalence. [Aggregate, paired analysis and audit hashes](arm_results/sol61_n5_launch_20261009.json).

<summary>Control audits, accounting and remaining comparability gaps</summary>

The control campaign audited all 745 records with zero selector or teacher calls. Each condition used one H200, eight CPUs, 120 GiB RAM and eight local browsers. Every attempt remains charged to its own approved cap; no budgets were transferred.

| SFT N1 control | Allocation seconds | Cap, seconds | Browser attempts | Browser cap | Judge HTTP calls | Call cap | Conservative judge charge, $ | Cap, $ |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| WebVoyager | 8,796 | 21,600 | 595 | 655 | 420 | 2,620 | 1.8753300 | 30 |
| DeepShop | 4,954 | 10,800 | 150 | 165 | 101 | 660 | 0.5487225 | 10 |

The WebVoyager audit checked all 595 records, 7,595 one-proposal decisions, 7,604 actor receipts, all available saved images and native judge bindings. Of 573 native-valid N1 trajectories, 417 received parsed GPT-4o verdicts and 156 retained native unjudged zeros (137 turn limits, 14 generation-length limits and 5 format failures). The 22 invalids comprise 5 missing-turn-sample exceptions, 4 environment-step errors, 9 failed actor requests, 3 native judge parse failures and 1 episode timeout. The audit preserves partial exception payloads and checks their available saved history; it does not invent missing terminal images or verdicts.

DeepShop's full review checked all 150 records, available saved images, 2,618 one-proposal decisions, 2,619 actor receipts and native verdicts. Of 145 native-valid N1 trajectories, 101 received a GPT-4o verdict and 44 retained unjudged native zeros (42 turn limits and two generation-length limits). Its five invalids comprise four environment-step errors and one failed actor request.

Both controls have finished W&B runs and reconciled lifetime accounting, with no selective outcome retries or rejudging. DeepShop has 150 explicit browser-exit messages. WebVoyager has 590 normal exit messages; five initial screenshot/reset failures take a separate frozen, awaited cleanup path, supported by later port reuse, no cleanup warnings and final scheduler/cgroup evidence. Pool-counter logs were not retained for those five. Controller-owned process groups, zero-exit Slurm batch/extern steps and released controller locks were verified. Postexit SSH was denied by PAM, so this is scoped resource teardown evidence rather than a physical whole-node scan.

Both OM2W controls use the same 300-task file, official SFT revision, pinned actor-policy hash, local browsers, T=0.7/top-p=0.9/native default top-k, 1,024 actor tokens, 30 turns, full text history/latest screenshot and canonical o4-mini/AgentTrek judge as Sol61. The shared actor, browser, reward and native evaluator source files are byte-identical. The October 7 seed-45 control is the latest completed matching control located; the earlier API-study control also matches Sol61's seed-42/server-4200 settings.

The seed-45 control uses server seeds 4500/4501, versus 4200/4201 for Sol61 and the API-study control. FlashInfer ignores per-request seeds, so matching seed labels do not imply identical trajectories. Campaign wrappers, interleaving and collection times differ; core-file identity does not prove complete runtime equivalence. Website/judge drift and differing invalid sets remain. No new paired interval or common-valid estimate is claimed for the historical OM2W controls. Existing native outcomes, including valid unjudged zeros, are unchanged.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Paired comparison, latency and outcome definitions</summary>

Across all 300 OM2W tasks, both conditions succeeded on 101, only medium on 36, only high on 30, and neither on 133. Intervals use the frozen paired task bootstrap: 10,000 resamples, seed 42. They quantify task sampling, not website drift, model-alias drift or judge error. The common-valid analysis conditions on measurement availability in both conditions.

| Per-task mean, all 300 committed episodes | Medium | High |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Actor output tokens across all five proposals | 23,843.10 | 25,273.64 |
| Selector output tokens, including reasoning | 631.78 | 1,465.80 |
| Selector service seconds | 41.42 | 61.51 |
| Episode elapsed seconds | 225.18 | 259.35 |

These are committed-episode measurements, including invalid episodes; service times are summed within each episode and are not allocated GPU time. Two task shards interleaved medium and high, so per-shard allocation time cannot be attributed to one reasoning effort. Failed attempts and all API reservations are accounted separately.

Native unjudged zero outcomes remain valid: OM2W has 63 in medium and 68 in high, including step limits, generation-length failures and format failures. Its other 395 valid outcomes received the native o4-mini verdict. DeepShop N5 has 50 step-limit zeros and 97 native GPT-4o-judged outcomes. Invalid records remain saved and excluded only from valid-only rates. OM2W's invalids include browser reset/navigation failures, missing observations, a native episode timeout and actor requests whose prompt plus reserved output exceeded the context limit. The frozen client guard checks prompt length alone; this boundary mismatch is retained as a harness limitation, with no selective retries or changed labels. The native judge action-history parser omits unsupported tool names, including observed `select_option` calls; saved canonical requests and verdicts are preserved. The audit verifies integrity and protocol, without independently rejudging semantic correctness.

<details>
<summary>Controlled protocol, endpoint verification and accounting</summary>

All four conditions use the corrected September proposal protocol: local browsers, actor T=0.7/top-p=0.9, native default top-k, 1,024 actor tokens and 30 turns. GPT-6.1 Sol selects an index from the full proposals and current screenshot, with the same 2,048-token output cap for medium and high. Incomplete responses retain their validity and cost consequences. The arms share the proposal protocol; stochastic trajectories and candidates differ. Recorded server seeds 4200/4201 do not establish deterministic replay because FlashInfer ignores request seeds.

Online-Mind2Web uses canonical o4-mini/AgentTrek; WebVoyager and DeepShop use their native GPT-4o prompts and parsers, up to 30 screenshots, and an explicit 4,096-token judge cap. The earlier GPT-5.6 Sol N=5 result is a historical reference. Earlier local RL actor-only WebVoyager/DeepShop cohorts use different weights and T=0.6/top-p=0.95/top-k=20/4,096-token actor decoding.

The OM2W audit covered all 600 records, 44,240 actor sampling receipts, 8,828 full N=5 selector input/trace bindings and 395 native judge bindings, preserving every available rollout/image and all invalid outcomes. Frozen source, finished W&B histories and owned-process teardown passed. Direct postexit node inspection was unavailable because SSH authentication was denied; teardown verification uses owned process-group receipts, scheduler/cgroup completion and released controller locks.

Shared OM2W API ledgers are counted once across the two shards. All requests settled, with zero unresolved reservations. Usage-derived API cost is **$116.0483339**, including cache-write tokens; the authoritative conservative charge is **$116.0615759**. Nominal diagnostic cost fields omit cache-write premiums and are not used for accounting.

DeepShop's exhaustive audit covered all 150 records, 13,685 actor sampling receipts, 2,737 selector input/trace bindings, all 97 native judge bindings, and full pixel decoding of 2,364 unique committed images. The original 23 records and all interrupted-attempt evidence were preserved. Frozen source, finished W&B history, final scheduler accounting and owned-process teardown passed independent checks.

Received DeepShop API usage costs **$42.5816541** at frozen prices, including cache-write tokens; an additional **$0.166405** remains reserved for the interrupted provider-error request. The authoritative conservative total is **$42.7523626**, including that reservation. These are receipt-based calculations, not an independently verified provider invoice. Every attempt remains charged; no budget was added or transferred.

The WebVoyager audit covers all 595 records, 35,580 actor sampling receipts, 7,103 full N=5 selector bindings and 463 native GPT-4o judge responses. Of the 565 valid outcomes, 461 received parsed native verdicts and 104 are native unjudged zeros: 100 step limits, three generation-length limits and one format failure. Two of the 463 judge responses lacked the required verdict tokens and remain invalid. The other 28 invalids comprise 13 actor HTTP400 generation failures, ten missing-turn-sample exceptions and five environment-step errors. All native outcomes are preserved without selective retries or rejudging. Frozen source, all 595 finished W&B task-history rows and owned process-group teardown passed. Physical postexit inspection was denied by the scheduler's PAM policy; teardown evidence is scoped to owned groups, scheduler/cgroup completion and the released controller lock.

The campaign ceilings remain **26 H200-hours**, **$625** for APIs and **1,480 physical browser attempts**, with eight concurrent episodes per job. Each job has one H200, eight CPUs and 120 GiB RAM; the two Online-Mind2Web shards have six hours each, WebVoyager ten and DeepShop four. Budgets are separate from branching. All **1,345 requested records** and the paired OM2W comparison are verified. The campaign used 41,830 allocation seconds (11.6194 H200-hours), 1,354 browser attempts and $246.4387211 in conservative API charges/reservations. The one unresolved DeepShop reservation remains charged; no budget was added or transferred.

## MolmoWeb 4B/8B: paired Sol selection and access-filtered controls

**The retained 4B WebVoyager control rates are 45.19% raw and 56.07% after excluding identified access/infra exposures.** This is a partial 582-task cohort; 13 of the requested 595 tasks remain unresolved. The filter removes 129 episodes, including nine successes, and changes the task mix. It is a diagnostic of the observed local-browser cohort, not a prediction of performance under Browserbase.

**Following control review, the user approved all six paired N=5 + GPT-6.1 Sol medium evaluations on October 10.** The 4B/8B WebVoyager and DeepShop N5 jobs are running; both Online-Mind2Web jobs are queued with dependencies that keep the total at four jobs and 32 browsers across the suite. They use the existing reserved N5 budgets and unchanged actor/browser/judge settings. No complete N5 cohort or selection improvement is established yet. Five N1 controls are independently complete: 8B WebVoyager, both DeepShop and both Online-Mind2Web cohorts. The 4B WebVoyager control remains partial at 582/595 records.

**N5 collection has a runtime confound:** 56 of the first 83 committed episodes hit the unchanged 30-minute wall limit, generally before reaching 30 decisions. Eight browsers were sharing one serial native predictor. Collection was restarted with two concurrent rollouts per job within the original resource caps; all committed outcomes remain, and no committed timeout is retried. The first 94 post-repair episodes have now passed artifact verification with no timeouts, including 44 full 30-decision episodes. Filtered early scores preferentially retain shorter episodes and do not establish selection quality. See the runtime audit and interim paired metrics below.

The two headline metrics below use the same saved verdicts. **Raw** divides successes by all observed task records, including committed invalid outcomes; **access/infra-filtered** removes any episode with identified access/infra evidence, whether it succeeded, failed or recovered. Missing records remain unresolved. Native and AgentTrek scores remain separate.

| Benchmark | N1 actor | Judge | Observed tasks | Raw successes | Raw success | Retained tasks | Retained successes | Access/infra-filtered success |

| Online-Mind2Web | 8B | AgentTrek | 300 | 76 | 25.33% | 229 | 74 | 32.31% |

**8B WebVoyager is now verified complete: 44.37% raw and 54.86% access/infra-filtered.** The same fixed filter excludes 132 episodes, including 10 successes. Compare the 4B partial and 8B complete cohorts with their different denominators in view; these rates alone do not establish a reliable model ranking. [8B control W&B](https://wandb.ai/zixianma/openwebrl-evals/runs/e8780ff9ffb94d6d8bb9d6d9f16e2933).

The filter is fixed before collecting N5 outcomes and applied identically to both conditions. Paired N5−N1 comparisons use common observed tasks for raw rates and the intersection of retained tasks for filtered rates, with paired task-bootstrap uncertainty. Separately filtered arm averages alone do not establish selection benefit. Collection is sequential and website changes remain a caveat. These are single-draw task comparisons, not repeated-seed estimates.

<summary>N5 inference-queue diagnosis and bounded recovery, October 10</summary>

Thirty sampled generation receipts per active condition measured mean native prediction times of 2.8–3.4 seconds and mean queue waits of 15.0–23.6 seconds. Five proposals per decision across eight browsers caused frequent episode wall deadlines despite busy GPUs. This is collection infrastructure evidence, not a measured ranking of selectors.

The repair reduces admitted rollouts to two per job, below the approved eight-browser ceiling. Native weights, local browser implementation, decoding, deterministic draw seeds, five raw proposals, Sol medium selection, judges, 30 decisions and the 1,800-second episode limit are unchanged. The repair passed 85 offline checks, including rejection of committed-outcome retries and altered interruption evidence. All 2,160 existing N1/N5 records and all attempts remain preserved. Only 32 proven pre-deadline, uncommitted controller interruptions can be replayed; existing timeouts retain explicit raw zeros and their frozen filter classifications.

| N5 actor | Benchmark | Committed before repair | Wall timeouts | Prior allocation seconds | Replacement seconds | Stage cap seconds |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 4B | WebVoyager | 24 | 15 | 5,197 | 23,580 | 28,800 |
| 4B | DeepShop | 21 | 14 | 5,196 | 9,180 | 14,400 |
| 8B | WebVoyager | 21 | 15 | 4,758 | 38,400 | 43,200 |
| 8B | DeepShop | 17 | 12 | 4,028 | 17,520 | 21,600 |
| 4B | Online-Mind2Web | 0 | 0 | 3 | 21,540 | 21,600 |
| 8B | Online-Mind2Web | 0 | 0 | 3 | 32,340 | 32,400 |

Every attempt is charged to its original stage; replacement time is rounded down, and N1 balances remain separate. The two Online-Mind2Web successors follow the updated dependencies. Maximum concurrent jobs remains four; the repaired controller admits at most eight browsers across those four jobs. The full requested cohorts are still incomplete. Final raw/common-task and filtered/common-valid comparisons must disclose the mixed admission phases and timeout coverage; excluding timeouts alone does not establish a fair 30-decision comparison.

<summary>First post-repair validation and interim paired metrics, October 11</summary>

Snapshot: 2026-10-11T08:14:58.100060+00:00. **The first 94 post-repair episodes finished without wall timeouts**, including 44 that reached all 30 decisions. The audit verified 7,345 artifact files, 1,947 images and all 1,947 five-proposal selection decisions. The longest of these completed episodes took 1,107 seconds. Mean queue waits across sampled generation receipts are now 1.4–2.0 seconds. Frozen actor settings, actual Sol medium requests, native GPT-4o responses, W&B and separate stage caps passed; all 2,160 previously committed records remain unchanged.

**These are incomplete, infrastructure-confounded diagnostics, not evidence of a selection improvement.** All 56 original timeout outcomes remain in the following raw counts. Removing them preferentially retains faster-finishing episodes; common-valid pairing and its bootstrap interval do not remove that selection bias. Both Online-Mind2Web N5 runs remain queued. At current throughput the requested full cohorts will not fit their remaining time caps; collection will stop partial at those caps.

| N5 actor | Benchmark | Observed tasks | Raw successes | Raw rate | Filtered tasks | Filtered successes | Filtered rate |

Intervals use 10,000 paired task-bootstrap resamples, seed 20261010; they quantify sampling variation within the observed subset only. The filter excludes one N5 success for 8B WebVoyager and zero for the other three N5 cohorts. All four raw paired intervals include zero.

<summary>Exposure filter, incomplete coverage and original rollout-valid rates</summary>

The observation-only classifier excludes identified CAPTCHA/verification, access denial, HTTP 429/502/503, a verified site-function 404 transition, and structured worker failures. It applies to successful and unsuccessful episodes, including recovered exposures. Ordinary step-limit failures, outdated dates, wrong answers, guessed bad URLs, generic 404s and empty search results remain included. Image-based exclusions use frozen visually checked evidence templates; URL/title rules and structured failures supplement them. These rules may miss other infrastructure failures. Entire affected task groups can disappear from the retained subset, so filtered rates are not a counterfactual estimate of Browserbase performance. Future evidence-rule corrections must recompute both conditions.

The 4B WebVoyager cohort has eight interrupted and five untouched tasks. Its 184 seconds of unused N1 time cannot cover another launch with the fixed shutdown reserve. The saved outcomes passed their artifact audit, but the control remains incomplete. N5 keeps its separate existing reservation; no unused N1 time is transferred.

The earlier internal rollout-valid flag is narrower than this exposure filter; it does not identify most CAPTCHA/access blocks. The original complete-control audit table remains below for traceability:

On Online-Mind2Web, AgentTrek assigns unjudged zero to valid episodes without a terminal `[EXIT]`: 182 for 4B and 197 for 8B. Its judged subset is not the benchmark denominator. Both judges score the same saved episodes. The native judge favors 8B, whereas AgentTrek favors 4B; these cohorts alone do not establish a reliable actor ranking. All N1 selector counts remain zero.

All attempted work is charged. The remaining 184 seconds round down to a three-minute allocation, entirely consumed by the existing 180-second shutdown reserve. API/browser headroom cannot substitute for allocation time; the separate N5 reservation and other controls' balances are unavailable for N1 recovery. This cohort and the six-control suite remain incomplete.

</details>

The approved paired design contains the following six control cohorts and six matching N5 cohorts:

| Benchmark | Tasks per actor | Actors | N1 control episodes | Scoring |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | --- |
| WebVoyager | 595 | 4B, 8B | 1,190 | Native MolmoWeb GPT-4o |
| DeepShop | 150 | 4B, 8B | 300 | Native MolmoWeb GPT-4o |
| Online-Mind2Web | 300 | 4B, 8B | 600 | Native MolmoWeb and AgentTrek, reported separately |
| **Total** | **1,045 unique benchmark tasks** | **2** | **2,090** | **Six controls** |

Each remaining control requires the same complete record, image, verdict and accounting audit. Missing infrastructure/judge outcomes remain unresolved; partial collection stays incomplete.

The full requested comparison is 4,180 episodes across 12 conditions. N5 requests all 2,090 task slots; partial N1 coverage limits the paired denominator until missing control records are available. No selective outcome retries are allowed.

**Both Online-Mind2Web judges score the same saved actor episodes; they do not trigger extra continuations.** The native MolmoWeb judge decomposes the goal, assesses each supplied screenshot, then produces a final verdict: **S+2 logical calls for S screenshots**, before retries. The prior AgentTrek protocol instead uses the task, action history and last supplied actor observation in one terminal assessment, with its existing completed-episode eligibility rule. Truncated and format-ineligible episodes retain explicit unjudged zeros in that protocol. Report each judge's eligible/judged counts, overall and valid-only rates, and disagreement on the commonly judged subset. Never select the better judge outcome or pool the two scores.

<summary>Frozen scientific design, source and comparability</summary>

Use the official [MolmoWeb repository](https://github.com/allenai/molmoweb/tree/bab3fc3f1bff5b42c0624c073b68ddf9ad651d91) at `bab3fc3`, its native predictor, prompt, action parser and history handling. Checkpoints are [MolmoWeb-4B-Native](https://huggingface.co/allenai/MolmoWeb-4B-Native/tree/7623f7161ab00dd130e5a9f6e755d2a7cc32629c) and [MolmoWeb-8B-Native](https://huggingface.co/allenai/MolmoWeb-8B-Native/tree/b91f4f718120011a53643d3c1efc607f8b92e514). Both arms use temperature 0.7, top-p 0.8, one beam, at most 1,024 generated tokens, 30 decisions, ten prior actions and the current screenshot. N1 draws one action and makes no selector call. N5 draws exactly five from the same state/prompt, retains duplicate or malformed raw proposals, and lets Sol medium return a strict index into that unchanged panel; no candidate replacement, deduplication or actor fallback. The selected action enters native history once. Sol uses a 2,048-token output cap.

Local SimpleEnv browsers are used throughout. This is **not a reproduction of the paper's Browserbase/advanced-stealth environment**; historical paper success rates and the earlier OpenWebRL-SFT decoding settings are contextual comparisons, not matching controls. Native MolmoWeb judge inputs are unchanged. The AgentTrek adapter serializes MolmoWeb's native actions rather than applying the SFT-specific tool parser, preserving all executed actions. A separately saved immediate post-action screenshot is audit evidence and does not replace the last supplied observation in AgentTrek's input. Native OM uses o4-mini/2,048 completion tokens; AgentTrek retains o4-mini/4,096 completion tokens and its existing prompt/schema/seed/eligibility rules.

**October 10 runtime correction:** a 9,320-token input could exceed the upstream 10,240-entry rotary-position table during the unchanged 1,024-token generation allowance. The recovery sizes the default RoPE table for the full input plus generation; weights, frequencies, model configuration, prompt, history and sampling stay unchanged. CPU tests reproduce the boundary error and preserve existing-position outputs exactly. The exact saved input then passed on the GPU with all 1,024 output tokens. All 183 committed 8B Online-Mind2Web outcomes were retained; eight infrastructure-interrupted rollouts resumed within the original time and API caps. The regression generation was charged and contributes no benchmark outcome. This is a runtime repair, not a completed performance result. [Validation and recovery accounting](arm_results/molmoweb_n1_rotary_recovery_20261010.json).

Source, checkpoint, task, candidate, screenshot, verdict and API identities are retained privately. Separate evaluation runs go to `openwebrl-evals`. Final completion requires exhaustive record/image/verdict checks, paired analysis, all-attempt accounting and owned-worker/browser teardown; count coverage alone is insufficient.

<summary>Approved resource ceilings, N5 activation and recovery accounting</summary>

Each row is a lifetime N1/N5 budget with **1 H200, 8 CPUs, 120 GiB and eight browser workers total**, including startup checks and every recovery attempt. CPUs were reduced from the approved ceiling of 16 to meet the cluster limit. At most four jobs run concurrently: **4 H200, 32 CPUs, 480 GiB and 32 browsers**. These are hard ceilings, not a throughput forecast or a guarantee of full coverage.

| Actor | Benchmark | All-attempt H200 hours | Sol ceiling, USD | Native judge ceiling, USD | AgentTrek ceiling, USD | Total API ceiling, USD |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 4B | WebVoyager | 16 | 200 | 70 | 0 | 270 |
| 4B | DeepShop | 8 | 75 | 22 | 0 | 97 |
| 4B | Online-Mind2Web | 12 | 100 | 300 | 10 | 410 |
| 8B | WebVoyager | 24 | 200 | 70 | 0 | 270 |
| 8B | DeepShop | 12 | 75 | 22 | 0 | 97 |
| 8B | Online-Mind2Web | 18 | 100 | 300 | 10 | 410 |
| **Total** | | **90** | **750** | **784** | **20** | **1,554** |

**The initial N1-only allocations reserve 45 of the approved 90 H200 hours:** 4B WV/DS/OM receive 8/4/6 hours; 8B receive 12/6/9 hours. The October 10 approved amendment adds $24 solely to N1 native judging: WebVoyager $30 → $40 and DeepShop $10 → $12 for each actor. Controls therefore have a $414 judge envelope ($404 native plus $10 AgentTrek), 2,300 browser starts and 69,000 local generations; selector allowance is zero. Compute and HTTP/browser counts are unchanged. [Amendment accounting](arm_results/molmoweb_n1_judge_amendment_20261010.json). Actual time from every attempt charges the corresponding lifetime row, and unused time is never reset or transferred. The October 10 review authorization releases the separately reserved 45 N5 H200-hours and $1,140 API envelope ($750 Sol, $380 native judges and $10 AgentTrek), without extending any cap. Four startup-only N5 attempts consumed 14 allocation seconds before model/API work; they remain charged. The malformed launcher path was corrected and tested, replacements use residual stage time, and all original attempts remain preserved.

Native judge ceilings are N1/N5 $40/$30 for each WebVoyager actor, $12/$10 for each DeepShop actor, and $150/$150 for each OM actor; all Sol allowance belongs to N5. Each OM condition has a separate $5 AgentTrek allowance. Compute cannot transfer between jobs; API/browser caps cannot transfer between conditions or from other experiments. Aggregate limits are **4,600 browser starts, 414,000 local candidate generations and 256,360 actual HTTP attempts**. Every retry reserves its own physical HTTP attempt and worst-case cost before dispatch; unresolved charges retain their reservation. The first binding limit stops further paid work. Ordinary committed invalid outcomes are never selectively rerun, and a replacement receives only the unspent total allocation time.

## Actors alone

<a id="local-jev-actor-results-20261006"></a>

<!-- local-v2-actor-results:start -->

Jev is a separate actor system. Its judge-input adapter was repaired and all 23 valid DONE episodes rejudged from unchanged saved evidence. [Audit](arm_results/jev_actor_local_full300_20261006.json). Other actor runs and their limitations remain in the archive below.

## Piotr with an RL actor

<a id="piotr-rl-actor-20261007"></a>

| Actor | Selector | N | Tasks | Successes | Success |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Released OpenWebRL-4B RL | None | 1 | 300 | 128 | 42.67% |
| Released OpenWebRL-4B RL | Piotr SelectionARM | 5 | 300 | 162 | 54.00% |

**Paired gain: +11.33 pp [+5.33, +17.33]**; 59 ARM-only wins and 25 actor-only wins. Both arms are fresh. Relative to the SFT setup, only actor weights change: **30 steps, T=0.7, top-p=0.9, 1,024 tokens, seed 45**, with the frozen SFT prompt/frontend and Piotr's original SFT base. This is one run, not the RL model's native prompting benchmark.

The gain exceeds the latest SFT pair's gain by **+4.33 pp [−3.00, +11.33]**: a stronger benefit on RL is not established. This comparison reuses SFT episodes collected at a different time. [Aggregate and plots](arm_results/selectionarm_piotr_rlactor30_20261007/aggregate.json) · [Four-outcome paired comparison](arm_results/selectionarm_piotr_rlactor30_20261007/sft_rl_gain_comparison.json) · [Protocol and final accounting](ARM_INFERENCE.md#selectionarm-piotr-rlactor30-20261007).

## Selective sampling: exploratory gate

Sample one candidate; below **−0.215576 nats/token** full-response mean base-policy log-probability, sample four more and let Piotr choose from all five. Otherwise execute the first.

| Method | Tasks | Successes | Success | Gain vs SFT, pp | Paired 95% interval, pp |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Gated Piotr | 300 | 101 | 33.67% | +0.67 | [−4.33, +5.67] |

The gate triggered on **907 of 4,844 decisions (18.72%)**, averaging **1.749 candidates**. Its gain over SFT is inconclusive, and it trails always-Piotr by **−6.33 pp [−12.00, −0.67]**. Controls were collected separately; this does not establish noninferiority or matched wall-clock savings.

**Calibration limitation:** the exploratory cutoff is the 25th percentile of 278 saved SFT final-decision responses from these same evaluation tasks. The separate [benefit-based threshold study](ARM_INFERENCE.md#confidence-benefit-20261008) is now verified under the approved 59-pair fitting amendment: the frozen rule keeps the first action. On **20 usable pairs from 150 fixed held-out tasks**, it succeeds on 10 versus 7 for Piotr: **+15 pp [−5, +35]**, inconclusive. Replay coverage is **13.33%**; 17 usable pairs are from decisions 1–3 and 19 are from two sites. This is a single-intervention study, not an every-step gating result. The [follow-up proposal](ARM_INFERENCE.md#confidence-robust-20261008) replaces the 240-task placeholder with effect-based sizing: initially 448 usable fit and 448 usable held-out states for the 10-pp planning scenario, subject to replay reliability, fit stability and an expanded task pool. [Exploratory protocol and accounting](ARM_INFERENCE.md#likelihood-scaling-20261007).

<a id="training-task-pass5-pass8-20261006"></a>
## Frozen SFT training-pool coverage: five attempts to eight

**Observed task coverage rises from 64.65% to 73.20% (+8.55 percentage points).** Three fresh ordinary attempts rescue **171 of 707** tasks missed by the historical five. This uses the separate **2,000-task training screen** and the SFT checkpoint at iteration 0; it is not a held-out Online-Mind2Web evaluation or a trained-policy result.

| Coverage endpoint | Successful tasks | Rate |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Historical five attempts | 1,293 / 2,000 | 64.65% |
| Historical five + three fresh attempts on misses | 1,464 / 2,000 | **73.20%** |
| Rescue among historical misses | 171 / 707 | 24.19% |
| Rescue among five-valid-failure tasks | 166 / 682 | 24.34% |
| Rescue among misses containing invalid attempts | 5 / 25 | 20.00% |

The extension has **249 / 2,121 successful episodes (11.74% overall; 249 / 2,108 = 11.81% valid-only)**, with 13 invalid attempts. These episode rates apply only to historical misses, not to a fresh all-task pass@1 or pass@3 cohort. The collection uses local browsers, official SFT, T=0.8 / p=1 / k off, 1,024 response tokens, 15 turns and GPT-4.1/action_history judging.

All 10,000 historical records and 2,121 new primary records were audited, including terminal images for every valid new trajectory. The 1,293 prior successes required no new attempts. All four W&B runs finished with matching final metrics. Usage, including failed/interrupted physical attempts, is **21.23 H200-hours**, 2,137 browser dispatches, 602 judge calls and **$6.29 charged or reserved** within four separate approved caps. [Final aggregate and accounting](arm_results/rl_integration/training-sft-pass8-20261006.json).

This is historical-five plus fresh-three coverage across dates, not an exchangeable eight-sample estimator. Website drift remains possible. Native judge labels are unchanged; purposive checks found permissive positives, so the figures are judge-based rather than manually certified completion. The earlier guided follow-up rescued 78 / 682 five-valid-failure tasks; its dates and attempt budget differ from the fresh ordinary retries, preventing a matched-compute ARM comparison.

<details>
<summary>Original pass@k curve and rubric-difficulty analysis</summary>

The dataset difficulty value is the **number of reference rubric facts**, verified on all 2,000 tasks. Pass@1–4 below average subsets of the same five historical outcomes; invalid attempts count as no success.

| Rubric facts | Tasks | pass@1 | pass@2 | pass@3 | pass@4 | pass@5 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 5 | 1,297 | 37.22% | 51.27% | 58.91% | 63.82% | 67.23% |
| 6 | 542 | 32.47% | 44.58% | 51.51% | 56.31% | 59.96% |
| 7 | 111 | 38.92% | 51.44% | 56.94% | 60.00% | 62.16% |
| 8+ | 50 | 34.80% | 44.00% | 48.80% | 52.00% | 54.00% |
| All | 2,000 | 35.97% | 49.29% | 56.54% | 61.28% | 64.65% |

Spearman correlations with pass@1 through pass@5 are −0.052, −0.054, −0.057, −0.069 and −0.073. The pass@5 correlation's 95% website-bootstrap interval is **[−0.171, +0.033]** from 2,000 resamples over 76 websites. This selected difficulty ≥5 pool provides no clear monotonic relationship; rubric length is not a direct measure of browser interaction difficulty. Only 50 tasks have eight or more facts. [Aggregate counts, correlations, validity checks and input hashes](arm_results/rl_integration/training-sft-difficulty-passk-20261006.json).

</details>

Training with eight rollouts is a separate experiment on the original **2,102-task** pool. Its [uniform-G8 pilot reached iteration 10](RL_EVALUATION.md#uniform8-iter10-results-20261007), scoring 88 / 300 (29.33%) in an actor-only pass@1 evaluation. The pilot does not establish a training benefit from the screening coverage increase. Its [approved continuation to 60](ARM_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md#outcome56-uniform8-to60-20261008) remains queued.
