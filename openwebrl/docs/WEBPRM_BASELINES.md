# WebPRM baselines

## Pilot status — October 10, 2026

**The evaluation pilot is prepared but has not launched; no live Online-Mind2Web success results exist.** The design covers 12 fixed tasks and six conditions, with a total limit of one H200 for two hours and USD 30 of actor/judge API spending, including retries. No allocation time or API spending has been used.

The shared browser fixture and 31 focused CPU tests passed. The controller distinguishes attempted-invalid episodes from missing episodes, stops scheduling at resource limits or authentication failures, and reports a complete cohort only after all 72 task × condition cells were attempted. The independent analyzer verifies saved identities, rollouts, screenshots, terminal judge responses and API accounting. Partial cohorts receive no paired success estimates.

<summary>Serving preparation and remaining validation</summary>

The models use bounded KV caches: 32,768 tokens for Shepherd (4.5 GiB) and 65,536 for Arbiter (3.5 GiB), calculated from the released architectures and BF16 KV tensors. SGLang uses a 0.70 memory-profiling ceiling for each server. Concurrent GPU startup and local model preflight remain unverified. Context limits, model weights, prompts and scoring are unchanged.

The real browser fixture passed native Arbiter accessibility-tree observations, typing/clicking, tab lifecycle and terminal-chat execution, plus Shepherd author preprocessing. Before paid episodes, local model preflight must verify checklist generation, label probabilities and Arbiter verdict parsing. Truncated actor, critic and terminal-judge responses are rejected. All attempts and consumed resources must remain auditable across recovery.

## Supported-harness reproduction — October 9, 2026

Both released baselines support GPT-4o-mini as the actor, but their candidate generation, observations and critic interfaces differ. Compare each critic's improvement over controls in its own supported harness; a difference between those improvements is a comparison of complete systems, not an isolated estimate of reward-model quality.

The planned diagnostic uses the same 12 prespecified OM2W tasks for six conditions. All conditions use the frozen `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18` actor and the same terminal-success judge. Random-selection controls distinguish critic selection from the benefit of generating more candidates. Twelve tasks provide a mechanical pilot with wide uncertainty, not a definitive ranking.

| Family | Unguided control | Candidate-generation control | Reward-guided condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web-Shepherd | One sampled action | Random choice among up to five frequency-ranked actions from 20 samples | WebShepherd 8B checklist-probability selection from that pool |
| WebArbiter | First candidate from the released five-BLOCK policy response | Random choice among the five candidates | WebArbiter 7B pairwise knockout tournament |

Arbiter's unguided control preserves its released multi-candidate prompt; it is not a separate single-action prompt. Shepherd's online search loop is reconstructed from the paper because its repository does not release that loop. Its actor prompt comes from the authors' public BrowserGym demo. Published WebArena-Lite results and static Mind2Web preference accuracy must remain separate from live Online-Mind2Web success.

The Shepherd serving script names `WebShepherd/WebShepherd_8B`. Public repository metadata shows the same 15 file objects, including all weight-shard LFS digests, as the staged LangAGI-Lab checkpoint. This is checked rather than assumed from model names.

Arbiter's released viewer critic prompt differs from the benchmark prompt used with its released model. The pilot uses the official benchmark's WebArena prompt template, recovered with byte-exact roundtrips over all 4,600 released rendered rows. This combination of viewer actor and benchmark critic is an explicit adaptation, not evidence that the paper used precisely this online loop. The static rows supply a template only; their labels and trajectories are not live-task inputs.

Remaining choices must be recorded: hosted GPT model snapshot, BrowserGym and Chromium versions, browser lifecycle, token limits, serving engine, malformed-output policy, and thought/action splitting. Actor generation, full critic requests, response log probabilities, selection brackets and execution errors are saved privately. Highest available source fidelity does not establish exact reproduction of an unreleased paper harness.

<summary>Budget, analysis and evidence retention</summary>

The existing pilot authorization is one H200 for two hours, eight CPUs, 120 GiB RAM and a shared USD 30 API cap, including all retries. It does not authorize full-300 collection or a new allocation. Model staging and public local fixtures use no paid API calls. The allocation controller must own and await every server and evaluation worker, preserve consumed time across retries, and stop within both caps.

Report successes, valid attempts and planned tasks in separate count columns. Primary success uses all planned tasks in each arm as the denominator; report valid-only success separately. Compare within-family paired differences in percentage points with a paired task bootstrap and common-valid sensitivity. Relative percentage gain is undefined when the control has zero success. Incomplete cohorts cannot silently become completed comparisons, and invalid or malformed results cannot be replaced by whichever retry succeeds.

Retain task-file/cohort hashes, immutable model revisions, source/dependency manifest, shared API ledger, allocation attempt ledger, every task rollout and terminal verdict. Publish only aggregate results and methodology; task payloads and browser evidence remain local.
